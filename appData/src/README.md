# GB Studio Game Engine

Here be dragons.

There's a lot of weird things from this point onwards. Some of that comes from my inexperience with C, especially the flavour of C needed to compile with lcc, some comes from handling the different issues between the versions of GBDK available for Mac, Windows and Linux (a change to the Mac build can often break the Windows build for example) and some is because the code is in need of a refactor.

If I'd have known about it before starting this project the engine likely would have been based around [ZGB](https://github.com/Zal0/ZGB) which looks like a good starting point, though I assume some of the cross platform issues with GBDK will still be a problem here. Maybe this needs to be rewritten in [RGBDS](https://github.com/rednex/rgbds). Open to suggestions.
