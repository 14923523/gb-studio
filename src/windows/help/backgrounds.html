  <h1>Backgrounds</h1>
  <p>Each of your scenes requires a background image that defines how your scen should look. Add backgrounds to your project by adding files to assets/backgrounds</p>
  <h2>Requirements</h2>
  <p>All backgrounds get divided into 8x8px tilesets so the total image size must be a multiple of 8px in both width and height. A background has a minimum size of 160x144px (the screen size) and currently a background can be no larger than 256x256px.</p>
  <p>An image can contain no more than 192 unique 8x8px tiles at once due to memory limits. This means that even using the smallest background size possible you must repeat about half of your tiles. Where possible repeat tiles between images as they will be grouped together saving on total game size.
