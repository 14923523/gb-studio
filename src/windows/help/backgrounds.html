    <h1>Backgrounds</h1>
    <p>
      Each of your scenes requires a background image that defines how your
      scene should look. Add backgrounds to your game by adding PNG files to
      your project's
      <em>assets/backgrounds</em> folder.
    </p>
    <h2>Requirements</h2>
    <p>
      All backgrounds get divided into <strong>8x8px</strong> tilesets so the
      total image size must be a multiple of <strong>8px</strong> in both width
      and height. A background has a minimum size of
      <strong>160x144px</strong> (the screen size) and currently a background
      can be no larger than <strong>256x256px</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      An image can contain no more than <strong>192</strong> unique
      <strong>8x8px</strong> tiles at once due to memory limits. This means that
      even using the smallest background size possible you must repeat about
      half of your tiles. Where possible repeat tiles between images as they
      will be grouped together saving on total game size.
