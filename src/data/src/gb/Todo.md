# Todo

- Actor face direction doesn't work except for player
- Dialogue choice
- Triggers that require interact
- More than 256 flags
- Alternate UI themes (white on black? no frame?) for use during cutscenes
- Game over screen
- Reset sprites causing issue if walk on to right of stage (sprites flipped wrong)
- Battle action animations
- Game over screen after failure
- Set flag before battle to allow return to map on failure
- Script to read battle success flag for determining next script path
- Multi phase battles, scroll screen after each phase (2 or 3 phases?)
- Reduce use of game.h, moving everything out into smaller includes

# Low PR

- Animated map tiles

# Done

- Load encounter
- Script command trigger battle
- Return to map after success
- Battle transitions
- Battle fade out (slower on game over)
- Check for tile collision on immediate map load
- One frame of dialog window closing before battle transition
